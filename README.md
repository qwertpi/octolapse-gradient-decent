# octolapse-gradient-decent
[Octolapse](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse) 0.4 parses gcode to perform a linear search to attempt to find an optimal set of snapshot points that have minimal distance from one another, this is a proof of concept for the use of gradient descent to approximate a solution to this optimization problem

THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY AFFILIATED OR ENDORSED BY OCTOPRINT BUT FORMERLURKER IS THANKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS
