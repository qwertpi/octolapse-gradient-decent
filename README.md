# octolapse-gradient-decent
[Octolapse](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse) 0.4 parses gcode to perform a linear search to attempt to find an optimal set of snapshot points that have minimal distance from one another, this is a proof of concept for the use of gradient descent to approximate a solution to this optimization problem

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A gcode file
* jax `pip3 install jax jaxlib`
* Cython `pip3 install Cython`
* tqdm (for training only) (likely to already be installed) `pip3 install tqdm`

## Usage
-1\. Download this repo (`git clone https://github.com/qwertpi/octolapse-gradient-decent.git && cd octolapse-gradient-decent`  
0\. Install the prerequiestes (`pip3 install --user -U -r requirements.txt`)
### Compiling gcode parser
1\. Run the command `python3 compile_gcode_parser.py  build_ext --inplace`
### Runing the program
2\. Run main.py, answer the prompts provided and look at the `end.gif` file (red points are the snapshot point, green points are the nearest point within the print)  
(Depending on how powerful your machine is you may wish to stop execution by pressing ctrl+c (ensure to wait for the end.gif file to be created and the points to be saved! ie. only press ctrl+c once) before the program quits itself as by deafult it waits until the absolute best set of points it can generate when most of the movement happens in the earlier stages, the rate at which the loss is decreasing will provide a good indication as to when little movment is now occuring)
